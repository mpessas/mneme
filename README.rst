About
-----------

`Mneme` is a program that indexes urls so that they can be quickly
searched for in the future.

You can come across many pages in the internet with useful content
that you would like to reference in the future. However, using
bookmarks can quickly become tedious, as you will have to search
through all of them to find that one page that has the wanted
information.

With `mneme` you only index the content of the url of the page. When
you want to reference it in the future, you only have to perform a
search for terms that were in that page and `mneme` will return the urls
that included that terms.
